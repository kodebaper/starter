Okay, so we use this to make the writing in black form, usually in articles there are times when we want to write a script between the posts in the article, we need to make it different from normal writing.\nto make it very easy, we simply advance the writing/script that we will enter into the black form by pressing the Tab key 2x then writing or pasting the writing.\nMark text with rounded dots For this one I usually use it to describe many sub-subheadings, for example I\u0026rsquo;m describing the types of the Debian linux operating system and its derivatives, so I will mention the Debian operating system by starting [ROUND POINT] before the name of the operating system, an example is as follows.\n  Linux Ubuntu\n  Linux Mint\n  Kali Linux\n  etc\n  Can you see the round dot before the word \u0026ldquo;Linux\u0026rdquo; ? well I mean like that. For bloggers To make it very easy, we just need to give a sign [-] before the sentence we will give a round dot\nMakes the title underlined In this function I will give tips on how to make a large underlined title in the article or subtitles in each post. For more details, for example like this, I embed sub-headings in each article.\nexample subtitles 1 line example subtitles 2 lines Like this, as for making it also simple, namely giving a sign [##] in any desired title. for more details see the picture below.\nBut if we don\u0026rsquo;t want a line under the title, then we just need to remove one mark**#** before the title.

Cloudflare products are intermediaries for web visitors, and hosting providers for Cloudflare users [Wikipedia version description]. I got this explanation from Wikipedia, but for myself I understand Cloudflare is a CDN (Content Delivery Network) where Cloudflare itself is between the domain name and web hosting which has the ability to filter traffic and accelerate website access. As for additional security provided by Cloudflare, one of them is security from DDoS attacks and so on.\nI just got to know Clodflare about 6 months ago and started to be familiar with some of the features in it, I used Cloudflare as part of the Setup series when I did a custom domain on the GitHub page with the domain dotcom.

On this occasion, we will get to know more about what Hugo static site generator is and the 5 main reasons I chose to blog using Hugo.\nThis started with my strong desire to learn programming where I tried to get out of my scientific routine which was more involved with Networking, so I finally decided to learn trending programming, namely programming for mobile apps. Where the first step I took was to create a personal blog as my own personal record of how far I would learn mobile application programming. The first programming lesson that I will learn and document is the Kotlin programming language.\nAfter quite a process of looking for references here and there regarding the blog engine that I will use, finally I found a static site from Hugo as my choice to start a blog to document what I learn and indeed my hobbies are reading and writing, Of the many types Finally, my static site generator prefers Hugo.\nwhat is hugo static website?\nHugo claims to be the fastest SSG framework at the moment, but for myself who is still very new to the world of programming, the world of website or framework development, of course I am very enthusiastic about that statement, where in the future I will try and prove the statement as stated on the official Hugo website itself.\nthen what is hugo?\nHugo is a static web generator written in the Go programming language. Hugo was developed by Bjørn Erik Pedersen, Steve Francia, and other contributors. Hugo is an open source project under the Apache 2.0 License (Wikipedia\u0026rsquo;s answer). So basically Hugo is essentially a popular open-source framework for building a website, we can make this even if we are just getting into the world of blogging or just learning programming where Hugo himself makes it very simple, I only need a text editor and a terminal which is basically default already installed on my laptop operating system.\nSo what made me choose Hugo?   Hugo is lightweight and easy to learn even by beginners. This is my personal opinion\n  The large community is the reason why I chose Hugo, because every problem or obstacle we face in the Hugo Community forums is sure to be mostly discussed.\n  Complete documentation on Hugo\u0026rsquo;s official website, this is one of my favorites. I can freely start practicing building a website just by following the complete documentation on the Hugo website. Even to make a template according to my own wishes, I just have to follow the documentation available on the official Hugo website.\n  The reason for the budget limit is that you don\u0026rsquo;t want to bother renting a hosting service. I myself only have the capital to buy a domain, so how about hosting? Don\u0026rsquo;t worry because at Hugo there are many options for hosting, we can take advantage of free services such as GitHub, GitLab, Forestry or Netlify and many more. And all that we can get with the free service.\n  Become smarter, if this is what it has to do with it? I take an example from my own simple blog. Maybe for a website master, making a static site website with Hugo might be very easy, even for making templates. But this does not apply to a beginner like me, or those of you who are just starting to become a web developer. From Hugo we can understand the directory of a website, like it or not we start to know what GIT is, and over time we are faced with having to understand several programming languages ​​to make our own templates. Interesting right ? without realizing it, as time goes by, we begin to understand the world of websites, it remains only for us to develop the knowledge we have acquired to continue to hone our skills.\n  ","permalink":"https://www.santricyber.com/blog/what-is-hugo-static-site-generator/","summary":"What is Hugo\u0026rsquo;s Static Site Generator?

Tips for using templates made by other people In discussing this article, I will discuss the details of the template used on my current blog. But before discussing it, I also took the time to discuss tips on using templates made by other people so that we understand each section and its layout. Where are the things I do after downloading templates made by other people I will dissect and if necessary record the contents of the files in the template one by one.\nThen I will start reading and understanding the contents of the codes that are arranged in it, but the earliest thing I did at that time was to record the entire contents of the file in it, at least there are several points that I will discuss, including:\n What is the name of the template used? Why don\u0026rsquo;t I make my own template? What I did after finding the desired template.  Okay, let\u0026rsquo;s discuss the 3 points above for more details about this template.\n1. What is the name of the template used? The template I\u0026rsquo;m currently using for Hugo\u0026rsquo;s blog is a template called Hago theme which I got for free [HERE] or you can download it by going to GitHub to the people behind the template maker [HERE]. I like this template because it\u0026rsquo;s simple, it reminds me of my habit of reading articles on well-known sitesMedium, simple but good for reading every content of the content in it because in my opinion the layout of each component is inMedium it\u0026rsquo;s neat and uncomplicated. That\u0026rsquo;s how I felt when I found this template. The features presented by the creator for this template include:\n Responsive web Tags Page Categories Page Google Analytics Comments jQuery 2.2.4 Bootstrap 4.4.1 Awsome Font 5.8.2  Is it enough to get here the features? of course not, yes there are some that we have to perfect and adjust to our wishes. The name alone is a template made by someone else, so we adjust it to the creator, then we just add it for improvement.\nThe advantages that I get by using templates made by other people are:\n  Save time because I don\u0026rsquo;t make it from scratch\n  For beginners like me, it is very helpful to have a template like this where if I make it from scratch it will be more time consuming.\n  I have new knowledge, as I said because I am still very new to the world of programming so I will be carried away to want to learn what is needed to make a template like the one I am using.\n  Weaknesses by using templates created by other people include:\n  There are parts of the features in the template that are not what we want, this is certain because sometimes even though the front view of the template is what we want, there are other features that are far from our expectations.\n  It\u0026rsquo;s much more difficult to learn all the components that are built into the template because we didn\u0026rsquo;t design it from scratch.\n  In my opinion, a sense of satisfaction is lacking, because the overall content of the blog or the template is not entirely created by us.\n  2. Why can\u0026rsquo;t I make my own template? actually before I used this template, I had the chance to make my own template by following the guide on making a template from scratch for Hugo where I got this guide from a blog that was both built using Hugo but I think this blog is very good and always motivates me to have blog class this blog that is [Petani Kode] After some consideration, I feel that I haven\u0026rsquo;t had the opportunity to continue making templates that I\u0026rsquo;ve made and then attaching them to this blog because I\u0026rsquo;m currently focusing on learning mobile programming using the Kotlin programming language.\nI thought I would break the focus if I built my own template but right now I\u0026rsquo;m still excited about learning Kotlin, so I finally decided to use a template made by someone else while when the time is possible I will update my blog to use a template made by myself, where I just perfecting the template that I had made before.\nThis is also more about time efficiency where the faster the blog that I build with Hugo, the faster I will document every new knowledge that I learn and put it in writing on this blog.\n3. What I did after finding the template I wanted. What needs to be understood after finding a template to your liking is not expecting it to be perfect for everything in the template, of course, because of course we need other changes from the template that we have downloaded or at least perfect the features because the templates that other people make are not necessarily the whole as expected. After point tips like at the beginning of this article I discussed where I already understood the entire contents of the file that created the template on this blog, what I did after finding the template I wanted was I started slowly to change some parts, as it seems now I can I feel that there has been a slight change in the appearance of the original template from its creator until now I am using it. Oh he did not forget I also added some parts of the script for needs THIS in some of these template files.\nHope this article helps, happy learning!\n","permalink":"https://www.santricyber.com/blog/get-to-know-theme-on-the-hugo-static-website/","summary":"0.

Because almost every time we use the Git service, we encounter problems, in my experience, error messages are definitely included, which will make it easier for us to trace errors so we can fix them. Another tip to make it easier for us to understand error messages is to try to learn English because understanding and being able to speak English will make it easier for us in all respects, moreover, in my opinion, most of the articles on the internet are available in English or for reading documentation.\nError can be resolved with this command Finally I got a solution to overcome the problem as above so we can push back to update to GitHub Page, this is the script\n# git pull --rebase  And the problem is solved, I can push back to git, good luck!\n","permalink":"https://www.santricyber.com/blog/error-failed-to-push-some-refs-to/","summary":"Some time ago I had encountered an error when I was about to post the latest article, as usual I updated articles on this blog because I was still using the services from the GitHub page and I had no intention of moving to use the services from Netlifiy or Forestry because I felt I was still convenient for doing everything, be it updating the latest articles, improving the blog or making changes by pushing it to GitHub.","title":"Error Failed to Push Some Refs To"},{"content":" In this time, right on Saturday night, I tried to see the progress of the performance of tools for SEO needs that were installed on my personal blog, among others, I installed Google Analytics, Google Search Console , and Bing Webmasters.

In the example in the image below, I deleted the domain santricyber.com ---\u0026gt; then SAVE \u0026ldquo;adjust to your domain name to delete first okay\u0026rdquo;\n  Up here it\u0026rsquo;s finished for matters of setting up domains on the GitHub Page.\nResetting the Management DNS on CloudFlare  after that I went to the settings on Management DNS on CloudFlare because from some of the references I read it was not the same as the settings from the DNS side that I did, then I made changes to DNS on CloudFlare\nThe configuration is at least as described below.\n \u0026lt;\u0026lt;Settings while still wrong\u0026gt;\u0026gt; ------------------------------ \u0026lt;Type\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Content\u0026gt; \u0026lt;TTL\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Proxy Status\u0026gt; A www 185.199.108.153 Auto Proxied CNAME santricyber.com santricyber.github.io Auto Proxied TXT santricyber.com google-site...... Auto DNS Only  From the settings for DNS on CloudFlare like this, of course it\u0026rsquo;s not quite right, and results in the HTTPS activated in the custom domain settings on the github page for that it returns me study the documentation that is widely scattered on the internet in the arrangement between custom domains on GitHub and DNS Management on CloudFlare. Okay until here it\u0026rsquo;s done,\n Return to custom domain settings on GitHub Page\nAfter the second point above is finished, now what I do is fill in the domain name that previously did not want to \u0026lsquo;checklist\u0026rsquo; the Enforce HTTPS, after filling it in then save it, after that we have to wait for the change to HTTPS and this feature cannot be checked yet because it takes time. After waiting about 20 minutes, I refreshed the custom domain page on GitHub and Enforce HTTPS can be activated by placing a check in the Enforce HTTPS section and changing the description on the custom domain GitHub Page to Your site is published at https http://santricyber.com/.\n  Until these three processes are completed, and problems like this are not always faced. Because in some cases custom domains on GitHub Pages can run smoothly without going through a process like this. Hopefully useful and eager to learn!\n","permalink":"https://www.santricyber.com/blog/solved-enforce-httpsunavailable-for-your-site-on-github/","summary":"Two days after the custom domain process for my blog was on the github page, after waiting for the DNS propagation process which does take quite some time usually up to 1x24 hours and doing some configuration related to DNS on cloudflare, I encountered a new problem where my blog for SSL from the setting side on GitHub could not be activated as a result I could only activate the blog\u0026rsquo;s SSL from the features on cloudflare but not for the GitHub Page settings , then what are the impacts if it\u0026rsquo;s like this?","title":"Solved Enforce HTTPS—Unavailable for Your Site on Github"},{"content":" Finally, from CMS, I decided to use a framework that is said to be the fastest framework.

After some time being confused about what engine to use for a personal blog, maybe in the future I will write a lot on my personal blog with this blog powered by Hugo.\nIt didn\u0026rsquo;t take me long to adjust to being a user of this new Hugo static site, because it\u0026rsquo;s quite easy to make and start operating it, even if the user is just getting acquainted with a static site like Hugo, provided there is a willingness to learn and of course read any documentation available on the official Hugo site. Because this is indeed one of the ways I learn and what I do is to get to know Hugo even deeper.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s my reaction after using a blog powered by a static site from Hugo? My answer is that I am quite comfortable and I know more about what my own blog is like, know the mechanics of my own blog from when I made it offline, until I deployed it on GitHub, so I know what Git is, so I know how to order a domain from a service provider and then change it to settings on the Github page, so I quite understand the DNS settings on the cloudflare service for my personal blog.\nFor me as a layman, Hugo himself is one of the reasons I now like the world of programming where my background is more focused on learning networking from when I was still in Vocational High School and currently working in the world of Networking. I felt that I had to start learning from the beginning about HTML, CSS, and BOOTSTRAP (because of the template requirements that I now install on this blog using Bootstrap).\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all for discussing my first reason, maybe where I finally chose Hugo to be a personal blogging machine, happy learning!\n","permalink":"https://www.santricyber.com/blog/why-migrate-to-hugo/","summary":"Finally, from CMS, I decided to use a framework that is said to be the fastest framework.

Then you are here using the free service provided by Cloudflare like I did, but for paid packages if you want it is also available. This preparation is important to speed up the custom domain process because after the domain we bought is active then we can immediately register our domain on the Cloudflare service.\n  That\u0026rsquo;s all for this article, I highly recommend this preparation to be fulfilled in order to facilitate our learning process to experiment with Hugo and GitHub Pages.

Like comparing between Linux, Windows and Mac OS. So whether it\u0026rsquo;s difficult or not, Linux has actually led me to keep learning until I can and start to understand the characteristics of the Linux operating system that I use.\nWhat did I get after that?\nSure enough, both subjects at Vocational Schools regarding programming, networking, I was greatly helped by the Linux Ubuntu that I used on my laptop, because there were lots of tutorials and lessons that were actually practiced using the operating system Linux in every article.\nFor you, the reason for migration is because of what? I hope that for those of you who want to migrate using the Linux operating system because you have a willingness to learn to deepen certain disciplines, this is not only because you have the reason that you want to use legal software, right, because you will definitely get this! and helping our country, of course, so that other countries get a bad image that Indonesians like to use pirated software, and the fact is that our country was once in the top ranking (forgot what order I was in) that this country is one of the countries with the largest users of pirated software\u0026hellip;. sad huh.\nOkay, let\u0026rsquo;s come back\nLet me take an easy example\u0026hellip;\nDo you want to master skills in server development?\nOr study cloud technology, which is currently increasingly trending and requires experts in the field of cloud servers.... .?\nIf so, this is the best step for you to decide to start focusing and pursuing learning with the Linux operating system, because from here the two questions above will be answered.\nOr even if you want to become an Security Engineer , then migrating to the Linux operating system, and learning the basics of the Linux operating system and then learning more is the solution.\nI draw conclusions here !!! That those of you who want to learn Linux and choose a distro that you really think are suitable to be your first choice distro for migrating to the Linux operating system, instill a strong intention to really learn about the knowledge you will learn.
