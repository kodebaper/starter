      <description>Some time ago I had encountered an error when I was about to post the latest article, as usual I updated articles on this blog because I was still using the services from the GitHub page and I had no intention of moving to use the services from Netlifiy or Forestry because I felt I was still convenient for doing everything, be it updating the latest articles, improving the blog or making changes by pushing it to GitHub.</description>

      <description>Two days after the custom domain process for my blog was on the github page, after waiting for the DNS propagation process which does take quite some time usually up to 1x24 hours and doing some configuration related to DNS on cloudflare, I encountered a new problem where my blog for SSL from the setting side on GitHub could not be activated as a result I could only activate the blog&amp;rsquo;s SSL from the features on cloudflare but not for the GitHub Page settings , then what are the impacts if it&amp;rsquo;s like this?</description>
