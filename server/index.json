Then when I opened my blog using an internet connection at the office, I had to go through verification which stated that the page being opened was not secure. I also don\u0026rsquo;t understand the Fortigate firewall device in the office where I work, doing verification like this on my blog.\nAs for problem solvers to overcome this problem as follows:\nFirst delete the domain on the GitHub Page\nI first delete the domain name that I entered in the GitHub Page settings, delete it then save it, just leave it blank first. In the example in the image below, I deleted the domain kodebaper.com ---\u0026gt; then SAVE \u0026ldquo;adjust to your domain name to delete first okay\u0026rdquo;\nUp here it\u0026rsquo;s finished for matters of setting up domains on the GitHub Page.\nResetting the Management DNS on CloudFlare after that I went to the settings on Management DNS on CloudFlare because from some of the references I read it was not the same as the settings from the DNS side that I did, then I made changes to DNS on CloudFlare\nThe configuration is at least as described below.\n\u0026lt;\u0026lt;Settings while still wrong\u0026gt;\u0026gt; ------------------------------ \u0026lt;Type\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Name\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Content\u0026gt; \u0026lt;TTL\u0026gt; \u0026lt;Proxy Status\u0026gt; A www 185.199.108.153 Auto Proxied CNAME kodebaper.com kodebaper.github.io Auto Proxied TXT kodebaper.com google-site...... Auto DNS Only From the settings for DNS on CloudFlare like this, of course it\u0026rsquo;s not quite right, and results in the HTTPS activated in the custom domain settings on the github page for that it returns me study the documentation that is widely scattered on the internet in the arrangement between custom domains on GitHub and DNS Management on CloudFlare. Okay until here it\u0026rsquo;s done,\nReturn to custom domain settings on GitHub Page\nAfter the second point above is finished, now what I do is fill in the domain name that previously did not want to \u0026lsquo;checklist\u0026rsquo; the Enforce HTTPS, after filling it in then save it, after that we have to wait for the change to HTTPS and this feature cannot be checked yet because it takes time. After waiting about 20 minutes, I refreshed the custom domain page on GitHub and Enforce HTTPS can be activated by placing a check in the Enforce HTTPS section and changing the description on the custom domain GitHub Page to Your site is published at https http://kodebaper.com/.\nUntil these three processes are completed, and problems like this are not always faced. Because in some cases custom domains on GitHub Pages can run smoothly without going through a process like this.

After some time being confused about what engine to use for a personal blog, maybe in the future I will write a lot on my personal blog with this blog powered by Hugo.\nIt didn\u0026rsquo;t take me long to adjust to being a user of this new Hugo static site, because it\u0026rsquo;s quite easy to make and start operating it, even if the user is just getting acquainted with a static site like Hugo, provided there is a willingness to learn and of course read any documentation available on the official Hugo site. Because this is indeed one of the ways I learn and what I do is to get to know Hugo even deeper.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s my reaction after using a blog powered by a static site from Hugo? My answer is that I am quite comfortable and I know more about what my own blog is like, know the mechanics of my own blog from when I made it offline, until I deployed it on GitHub, so I know what Git is, so I know how to order a domain from a service provider and then change it to settings on the Github page, so I quite understand the DNS settings on the cloudflare service for my personal blog.\nFor me as a layman, Hugo himself is one of the reasons I now like the world of programming where my background is more focused on learning networking from when I was still in Vocational High School and currently working in the world of Networking. I felt that I had to start learning from the beginning about HTML, CSS, and BOOTSTRAP (because of the template requirements that I now install on this blog using Bootstrap).\nThat\u0026rsquo;s all for discussing my first reason, maybe where I finally chose Hugo to be a personal blogging machine, happy learning!\n","permalink":"https://www.santricyber.com/blog/why-migrate-to-hugo/","summary":"migration, from CMS to Static site Hugo Finally, from CMS, I decided to use a framework that is said to be the fastest framework.

But the main point of all this is not here, I feel that Linux is my operating system of choice because besides continuing my education to the SMK level majoring in Computer and Network Engineering, I also have never operated a computer or laptop at all.\nThen what does the choice of \u0026ldquo;Ubuntu\u0026rdquo; linux have to do with the school major I took at the SMK Computer Network Engineering level and have never operated a computer?\nI came up with the idea after researching the Linux operating system, that later by using Linux I would learn a lot with that operating system, then with my drawback that at that time I had never used a computer/laptop at all I don\u0026rsquo;t know), I still don\u0026rsquo;t know the differences between the existing operating systems. Like comparing between Linux, Windows and Mac OS. So whether it\u0026rsquo;s difficult or not, Linux has actually led me to keep learning until I can and start to understand the characteristics of the Linux operating system that I use.\nWhat did I get after that?\nSure enough, both subjects at Vocational Schools regarding programming, networking, I was greatly helped by the Linux Ubuntu that I used on my laptop, because there were lots of tutorials and lessons that were actually practiced using the operating system Linux in every article.\nFor you, the reason for migration is because of what? I hope that for those of you who want to migrate using the Linux operating system because you have a willingness to learn to deepen certain disciplines, this is not only because you have the reason that you want to use legal software, right, because you will definitely get this! and helping our country, of course, so that other countries get a bad image that Indonesians like to use pirated software, and the fact is that our country was once in the top ranking (forgot what order I was in) that this country is one of the countries with the largest users of pirated software\u0026hellip;. sad huh.\nOkay, let\u0026rsquo;s come back\nLet me take an easy example\u0026hellip;\nDo you want to master skills in server development?\nOr study cloud technology, which is currently increasingly trending and requires experts in the field of cloud servers.... .?\nIf so, this is the best step for you to decide to start focusing and pursuing learning with the Linux operating system, because from here the two questions above will be answered.\nOr even if you want to become an Security Engineer , then migrating to the Linux operating system, and learning the basics of the Linux operating system and then learning more is the solution.\nI draw conclusions here !!! That those of you who want to learn Linux and choose a distro that you really think are suitable to be your first choice distro for migrating to the Linux operating system, instill a strong intention to really learn about the knowledge you will learn.
