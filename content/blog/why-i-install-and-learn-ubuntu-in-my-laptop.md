# I use Linux because I want to learn
 
. The main reason I chose the Ubuntu Linux operating system to install on my first notebook was, I was inspired by several technological devices that were built using the Linux operating system, one of which was where various technology servers were built. and developed using the Linux operating system (at that time I read git anyway). But the main point of all this is not here, I feel that Linux is my operating system of choice because besides continuing my education to the SMK level majoring in Computer and Network Engineering, I also have never operated a computer or laptop at all.
 
Then what does the choice of "Ubuntu" linux have to do with the school major I took at the SMK Computer Network Engineering level and have never operated a computer?
 
I came up with the idea after researching the Linux operating system, that later by using Linux I would learn a lot with that operating system, then with my drawback that at that time I had never used a computer/laptop at all I don't know), I still don't know the differences between the existing operating systems. Like comparing between Linux, Windows and Mac OS. So whether it's difficult or not, Linux has actually led me to keep learning until I can and start to understand the characteristics of the Linux operating system that I use.
 
**What did I get after that?**
 
Sure enough, both subjects at Vocational Schools regarding programming, networking, I was greatly helped by the Linux Ubuntu that I used on my laptop, because there were lots of tutorials and lessons that were actually practiced using the operating system Linux in every article.
 
## For you, the reason for migration is because of what?
 
I hope that for those of you who want to migrate using the Linux operating system because you have a willingness to learn to deepen certain disciplines, this is not only because you have the reason that you want to use legal software, right, because you will definitely get this! and helping our country, of course, so that other countries get a bad image that Indonesians like to use pirated software, and the fact is that our country was once in the top ranking (forgot what order I was in) that this country is one of the countries with the largest users of pirated software.... sad huh.
 
**Okay, let's come back**
 
Let me take an easy example...
 
`Do you want to master skills in server development?`
 
`Or study cloud technology, which is currently increasingly trending and requires experts in the field of cloud servers.... .?`
 
If so, this is the best step for you to decide to start focusing and pursuing learning with the Linux operating system, because from here the two questions above will be answered.
 
Or even if you want to become an *Security Engineer* , then migrating to the Linux operating system, and learning the basics of the Linux operating system and then learning more is the solution.
 
I draw conclusions here !!! That those of you who want to learn Linux and choose a distro that you really think are suitable to be your first choice distro for migrating to the Linux operating system, instill a strong intention to really learn about the knowledge you will learn. Then in essence you have strong goals and future goals why the Linux system you chose to migrate.
