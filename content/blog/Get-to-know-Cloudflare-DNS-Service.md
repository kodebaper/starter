Get to know what is Cloudflare and right now I'm only using Cloudflare's services to use the free service for setting up my blog's DNS, while on another occasion I will discuss how to set DNS on Cloudflare from the Github page for Hugo's blog static site.

Starting from this blog, deploying it to the GitHub page and then ordering a Domain**dotcom** from Domainesia, at that time the custom domain setup at Cloudflare was taking place. In the middle of the journey, there was a problem with the process of calling the domain from the beginning **mazzempong.github.io** become **santricyber.com** because the results don't just arrive at the custom domain on GitHub, but there is an advanced setup on Cloudflare. This is where I started learning and getting to know what Cloudflare is.

*So, what is Cloudflare ?*

Cloudflare is a content delivery network service, Internet security prevention and distributed domains. Cloudflare products are intermediaries for web visitors, and hosting providers for Cloudflare users [Wikipedia version description].
I got this explanation from Wikipedia, but for myself I understand Cloudflare is a CDN (Content Delivery Network) where Cloudflare itself is between the domain name and web hosting which has the ability to filter traffic and accelerate website access. As for additional security provided by Cloudflare, one of them is security from DDoS attacks and so on.

I just got to know Clodflare about 6 months ago and started to be familiar with some of the features in it, I used Cloudflare as part of the Setup series when I did a custom domain on the GitHub page with the domain **dotcom**. Isn't it interesting to use Hugo? the more we dive in, the more we know a lot of knowledge, for example, we get to know what services are provided by Cloudflare, then for other benefits, including because we don't just blog normally, but so there is additional knowledge that we learn by blogging through the satic site generator using Hugo.

I hope this article is useful, happy learning!
