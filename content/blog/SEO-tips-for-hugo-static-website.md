In this time, right on Saturday night, I tried to see the progress of the performance of ***tools*** for SEO needs that were installed on my personal blog, among others, I installed ***Google Analytics, Google Search Console , and Bing Webmasters***. It turned out to be interesting because there were several conveniences that I got from the *analytic tools* that I installed.

I find it easy to analyze how far my blog is known by search engines and reaches **users** who read my writings on the blog, another thing that is very interesting for me is exploring my personal understanding of programming knowledge, where I can find out how well the performance of the blog that I manage, find out how effective the writing of the code written on the blog is.

From all of this, I can draw three conclusions that I got from **point SEO optimization on my current blog**, including:

1. This all makes it easy for me to improve content that is easier to find by search engines or improve articles, article titles and in terms of using tags.

2. It directs me more to be able to ** optimize the blog ** from the results of performance monitoring which are still not good enough, in this case for example the length of time the blog loads because the image size is too large, writing code that is not effective and so on. All with ease I can read *report* reports from *Analytic* which are very complete.

3. Analysis that draws conclusions from the Google Analytics tool that explains how good the content I make is. I really feel that as you continue to monitor activity on a blog with *Analytic*, all kinds of possibilities open up, starting from content that must be continuously optimized, improving effective code writing to changing the appearance of a blog that is as simple as possible but still looks good.

There are at least three review points that I wrote according to my experience using **Analytic tools from Google for my** blog, in the future I will always *update* articles that always discuss the development of my * static blog * in optimizing with simple SEO techniques. Happy reading!
