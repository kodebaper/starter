description: "Consideration for migrating to a hugo static website"

-------------- 
Finally, from CMS, I decided to use a framework that is said to be the fastest framework. And it really feels like this is the first time I've tasted the fun of writing on a blog using a static site, for this other time I decided on a static site generator with Hugo.
because previously I was quite familiar with using the terminal on Linux, the experience of writing on a blog using Hugo really felt like blogging in a Linux terminal 'cut me off'. After some time being confused about what engine to use for a personal blog, maybe in the future I will write a lot on my personal blog with this blog powered by Hugo.
 
It didn't take me long to adjust to being a user of this new Hugo static site, because it's quite easy to make and start operating it, even if the user is just getting acquainted with a static site like Hugo, provided there is a willingness to learn and of course read any documentation available on the official Hugo site. Because this is indeed one of the ways I learn and what I do is to get to know Hugo even deeper.
 
What's my reaction after using a blog powered by a static site from Hugo?
My answer is that I am quite comfortable and I know more about what my own blog is like, know the mechanics of my own blog from when I made it offline, until I deployed it on GitHub, so I know what Git is, so I know how to order a domain from a service provider and then change it to settings on the Github page, so I quite understand the DNS settings on the cloudflare service for my personal blog.
 
For me as a layman, Hugo himself is one of the reasons I now like the world of programming where my background is more focused on learning networking from when I was still in Vocational High School and currently working in the world of Networking. I felt that I had to start learning from the beginning about HTML, CSS, and BOOTSTRAP (because of the template requirements that I now install on this blog using Bootstrap).
 
That's all for discussing my first reason, maybe where I finally chose Hugo to be a personal blogging machine, happy learning!
